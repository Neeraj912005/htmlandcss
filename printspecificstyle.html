            A local court in West Bengal’s Sealdah on Friday remanded the man accused of raping and murdering the young doctor at the R G Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata to 14 days of judicial custody.

            Sanjay Roy, the civic volunteer, was produced in the court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (ACJM), Sealdah, under tight security with a deputy commissioner ranked official present outside the court. Personnel of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) were also deployed to avoid any untoward incident.
            
            According to sources, the hearing was held in the judge’s chamber instead of the courtroom and no one was allowed inside.Twice last year, Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of R G Kar Hospital who is at the centre of a storm following the rape and murder of a 31-year-old doctor on the hospital premises, was transferred out over allegations of corruption but was swiftly reinstated both times.

            An orthopaedics professor, Ghosh’s tenure at R G Kar was marred by multiple controversies. This time, however, Ghosh, finds himself in a far tougher spot with the state government setting up a SIT to probe alleged financial irregularities at the hospital since January 2021.
            
            Allegations of corruption were first raised in June last year, following which Ghosh, 54, was transferred to Murshidabad Medical College. However, he was brought back within 15 days and reinstated as principal of R G Kar Medical College and Hospital.</p>
