      <P>id="local"> Writing a book or book chapter is different from an article because the author has more opportunity, with more pages allowed, to provide background information and discuss related content than in a manuscript for a journal. Writing a book requires time and commitment. An early consideration is whether the author or coauthors will write all of the chapters themselves or if the book will be a contributed text. In a contributed book, authors or coauthors write individual chapters under the guidance of an editor who assembles those chapters into a book. Authors with known expertise may be asked by a publisher to write a book. Usually, the acquisitions editor contacts the author to inquire about the author’s interest. The publisher is responsible for getting the book into production, copyediting the manuscript, designing the book, carrying out other details to produce it, and marketing it.
